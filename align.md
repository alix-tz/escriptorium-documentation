# Tutorial on How to Use the "Align" Functionality in eScriptorium

## Introduction  

The "Align" function in eScriptorium allows you to automatically align a version of the text of your document with the lines within your document. The goal of this function is to speed up the transcription process by providing a somewhat better transcription than what transcription models can do.  
The "Align" method is especially useful when you have other versions of your document like an edition of the same text in antoher manuscript. You should be mindful of the transcription practices in the text you use for your alignment as it would most probably differ from the transcription practices of the model you use or of your project. Yet, it does provide a faster way to get a better first transcription.

## Step-by-step Guide

0. Pre-requisite: images are already segmented
1. On the "Images" page of your document, select the images you would like to align with a transcription.
2. Transcribe the selected images using a transcription model appropriate for your document.
3. Click on the "Align" button (this functionality is not available on every eScriptorium instance).
4. In the "Align" modal window:
    4.1 Select the transcription layer on which to perform alignment: the one you created at step 2.
    4.2 Select your textual witness: the plain text file that you want to use for replacing the automatic transcription.
    4.3 Choose a name for the new transcription layer produced by the alignment (e.g. "aligned")
    4.4 Click on "Align"
5. Once your alignment is done, go to the transcription page on any of your images and change the transcription layer that is shown to the name used in 4.3 to correct the alignment.
