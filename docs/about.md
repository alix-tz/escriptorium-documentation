# About the eScriptorium Tutorial

!!! warning
    The section needs to be completed.

This webite was created with the intention to provide the community with a useful platform to share a clear and up-to-date documentation on the eScriptorium application, created within the frame of [SCRIPTA PSL](https://scripta.psl.eu/).

This documentation is not run by SCRIPTA and is instead created by the community of eScriptorium users, for the community.
