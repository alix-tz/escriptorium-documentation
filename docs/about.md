# About this eScriptorium documentation

This website was created with the intention to provide the community with a useful platform to share a clear and up-to-date documentation on [SCRIPTA](https://scripta.psl.eu/)'s eScriptorium application.

This documentation is not run by [SCRIPTA](https://scripta.psl.eu/) and is instead created by the community of eScriptorium users, for the community.  

If you want to know more about eScriptorium and its context of creation, you can read the [FAQ](FAQ.md) or go to [SCRIPTA](https://scripta.psl.eu/)'s website.

If you want to contribute to the discussions around this documentation, see "[How to contribute](contribute.md)"!
