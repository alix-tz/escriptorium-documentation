## Training rights

By default, not every user have the right to train models.

- If you do, a "Train" button will be displayed on a document's dashboard.

![image: the train button is visible when the user has the right to train](img/train/train_rights_yes.png "The train button is visible when the user has the right to train models")

- If you don't, the button won't be visible and you will not be able to start a training task through the [API](walkthrough_api.md)

![image: the train button is not visible when the user doesn't have the right to train](img/train/train_rights_no.png "The train button is not visible when the user doesn't have the right to train models")

If you are the administrator of your application you can activate this right in the [back-end](walkthrough_administrator.md#back-end). Otherwise, you should simply get in touch with the administrator of the server you are using.
