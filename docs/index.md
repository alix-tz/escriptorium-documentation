**eScriptorium** is a web application offering a workspace to manage the various steps of a transcription campaign. These steps can involve manual or automatic processes and be applied to printed documents or handwritten ones. The application uses [Kraken](https://kraken.re/) as a segmentation/transcription engine. Since its beginning in 2019, the [SCRIPTA PSL](https://scripta.psl.eu/) research group is responsible for its creation and development.

The goal of this tutorial is to facilitate learning how to use the application, including advanced techniques.
