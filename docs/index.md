**eScriptorium** is a web application offering a workspace to manage the various steps of a transcription campaign. These steps can involve manual or automatic processes and be applied to printed documents or handwritten ones. The application uses [Kraken](https://kraken.re/) as a segmentation/transcription engine. Since its beginning in 2019, the [SCRIPTA PSL](https://scripta.psl.eu/) research group is responsible for its creation and development.

You can find more information about eScriptorium and the context of its production in:

## Quick start üöÄ

The [**Quick-start**](quick-start.md) is intended as a tutorial to introduce completely new users to the basics of using eScriptorium. It should be envisioned as a gateway to the walkthrough section which is much more detailed.

## Walkthrough üö∂üèΩ

For example, [**Import data**](import.md) covers feature related to importing images, transcriptions or models in the application. The [**Automatic prediction**](predict.md) section covers features related to using models to predict the lay out (segmentation) or the transcription of a document.

For a more detailed index of the walkthrough section, see [**Walkthrough**](walkthrough.md).

## Terminology üìë
