!!! Warning
    This page is about contributing to the ***documentation*** of eScriptorium. To contribute to eScriptorium's source code, see: [contributing](https://gitlab.com/scripta/escriptorium/-/wikis/contributing)

The source code of this documentation is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/alix-tz/escriptorium-tutorial/) under a open license. It is accessible to anyone. It also means that anyone can suggest modifications.

These modification can be minor (you spot a missing s, a broken link, etc) or major (an information is out-dated, you want to add a whole new page, etc). Any reasonable modification is welcome, as long as it maintains this documentation up-to-date with the [eScriptorium application](https://gitlab.com/scripta/escriptorium).

Contributions can take two forms:

1. If you're not familiar with Github, you can simply [open a ticket](https://github.com/alix-tz/escriptorium-tutorial/issues/new) and both explain the problem and suggest a correction.

2. Even better, you fork the repository, make the changes yourself and submit it as a Pull Request, still providing a reason for the change. 

Before opening a ticket, make sure that it is not already handled by another issue or pull-request!

If you want to help us with already identified problems, you can also browse the [issues tagged with "help wanted"](https://github.com/alix-tz/escriptorium-tutorial/labels/help%20wanted).
