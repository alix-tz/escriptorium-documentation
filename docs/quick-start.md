!!! warning
    The section needs to be completed.

In this section, we offer a short tutorial which goal is to get you accounted with the interface of eScriptorium and some basic actions that can be performed on the application.

First of all, you need to ensure that you [possess an account](FAQ.md#how-can-i-have-an-escriptorium-account) either on a local installation of eScriptorium or on an online server. Then you can follow the instructions below:

[TOC]

## Forewords on URL syntax

eScriptorium is a decentralized application, meaning it can be deployed on many servers, including on locally simulated servers. In such condition, it is impossible to point to a URL which would work for every person. For this reason, we use what we think is a universal syntax to point to specific URLs: **place holders**. For example, if the eScriptorium application you have access to is located at `escriptorium.demo`, then "escriptorium.demo" is the `base URL` to any pages inside the application. In such a case, you should understand a URL such as `{base_url}/login/` as meaning `escriptorium.demo/login` (the placeholder `{base_url}` is replaced with your base URL). This is also true for local instances of eScriptorium, generally served at `localhost:8000` (where `{base_url}/login/` would be replaced with `localhost:8000/login/`). This syntax is used throughout this documentation.

## Logging into the application

As long as you are not logged in the application, many pages will not be accessible to you. To log in the application, go to your application homepage, and click on "Login", then enter your username and your password. You can find more information about this step [here](walkthrough_users.md#login-and-logout).

After successfully logging in, you are sent to `{base_url}/projects/` which is your overall dashboard. This page can also be accessed by clicking on "My Projects" in the top navigation bar (the link only appears when you are logged in).

## Creating a new project

In eScriptorium, the data is organized inside **projects** which contain **documents**, which in turn contain **document-parts**.
<!-- todo: this section might change if you explain this somewhere else, even though it makes sense to have it explained here -->

- A document-part is simply an image (a digitization) of a document: it can be the photography of a double page, a single page, or even cropped portion of such images. 
- A document is a collection of such images, similar to how you would organize a directory containing images on your file system.
- Projects can be understood as one more level to gather documents (groups of images) together, but they can be envisioned as workspace for a group of users working for the same project. For example, tags <!--todo: add link to page explaining tag when available --> are managed at project level, available for all the documents inside the given project.<!-- todo: send to voc section once there is one -->

You need to have at least one project in your dashboard to create and/or access a document and use eScriptorium's annotation features. Let's create a new project then!

Go to "My Projects" (`{base_url}/projects/`) by clicking on "My Projects" in the nav bar. It will display a list of projects, or an empty page. Now click on the "Create new Project" button: it will open a new page where you can simply type the name of your future project before clicking on "Create".

!!! Danger "Before creating a new project"
    Currently, **it is not possible to delete or rename a project**. We strongly advise you to first consider the actual necessity of creating a new project, and secondly to give enough reflection time to choosing the name of your new project. For example, you should avoid names such as "1" or "project" or "blah blah" to make it easier for you identify your projects later, when you will have several projects.  
    Also, note that if you share your project or a document in this project with another user, they will not be able to rename your project and will see the project name you chose: **the name of the project should be meaningful and compatible with sharing it with other users** (avoid such names as "this is my project" for example).

## Creating a new document

As detailed in the [walkthrough](walkthrough.md) section, you can only [import](walkthrough_import.md) images and data inside a document. Let's now create a document!





## Importing images

<!-- todo: doable only when IIIF import from Gallica will not be so limited that import misses some images... -->
<!--We will use the [IIIF import](walkthrough_import.md#3-from-iiif) feature, but if it does not work correctly for you, you can also download the corresponding images [here](#) -->
<!-- todo: add link to a downloadable .zip file containing images -->
<!-- and follow the documentation on how to [import images from the local file system](walkthrough_import.md#1-from-the-local-file-system). -->
<!-- example images are taken from https://gallica.bnf.fr/iiif/ark:/12148/bpt6k10750420/manifest.json -->

Let's import images [from the local file system](walkthrough_import.md#1-from-the-local-file-system). First, you need to download the file located [here](#)<!-- todo: add link a repo with the demo images -->.


Remaining steps:

- go inside sandbox tutorial and create a document
- fill the metadata of the document
- then load images with IIIF (have a backup with locally saved images)
- then apply segmentation
- then download a transcription model (EN ?)
- then correct the segmentation, maybe remove some lines and/or add regions
- verify that the lines are associated with a regions, and verify the reading order
- then apply a transcription model
- then manually correct the transcription
- then export the result with the images

Then point to other useful pages to go further.
