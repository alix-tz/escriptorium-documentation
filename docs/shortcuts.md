# Shortcuts and Tips

There are many features in eScriptorium and thus many buttons. Luckily, some shortcuts exist to facilitate working with the keyboard and avoiding having to click too many times or switch too often between the keyboard and the mouse.

The following page is an attempt to list all the shortcuts available in the application. It does not describe what the feature triggered by the shortcut is: you should envision this page as an advanced documentation for people already somewhat familiar with the application.

The list is distributed into sections corresponding to the pages or panels where the shortcuts can be applied.

!!! Note
    Most shortcuts are documented in the application, when you hover over a button or a clickable item.

!!! Note "URL syntax"
    See the [quick-start](quick-start.md) preamble if you don't know to read the URL described below.

## Images dashboard

Typical URL: `base_url/document/{doc_id}/images/`.

- hold ++shift++ after clicking on a thumbnail checkbox and before clicking on another one: select an interval of document parts

## Edition Page

Typical URL: `base_url/document/{doc_id}/part/{doc_part}/edit/`.

- ++control+arrow-right++ OR ++page-down++: go to the next element (or document-part)
- ++control+arrow-left++ OR ++page-up++: go to the previous element
- ++control+1++: toggle on/off the Metadata panel
- ++control+2++: toggle on/off the Source image panel

- ++l++: toggle the display of line order
- ++m++: toggle mask modes
- ++c++: toggle scissor mode, to cut through regions or lines
- ++t++ with an active selection of lines or regions: change the type of the selection (then use NumPad for additional shortcut on type selection)

## Virtual Keyboard

It is possible to add key binding in the configuration of the [virtual keyboard](virtual_keyboard.md#customize-a-virtual-keyboard), which are a sort of shortcut. You can use the creation/edition interface for virtual keyboard to manually set the key bindings.
